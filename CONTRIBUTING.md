## Avoid Conflicts 🏓  {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pythoniclaver/Dent-Clack
```

Verify if new remote has been added by running the command:

```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run

```terminal
git merge upstream/main
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks [read this article from Github](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

🏆 After this, the maintainers will review the PR and will merge it if it helps move the Code-Magic project forward. Otherwise, it will be given constructive feedback and suggestions for the changes needed to add the PR to the codebase.
