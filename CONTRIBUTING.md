# Contribution Rules üìë

This project thrives on contributions from the community! To keep things smooth, collaborative, and productive, please make sure to follow these rules carefully. Any violation of the rules could result in your pull request (PR) being closed or not merged. Here's how to contribute effectively to the **DentClack** project:

## Before You Start Contributing

1. **Read the Documentation**: Be sure to read the `README.md` file carefully. This file contains crucial information about the project, its goals, and guidelines that will help you understand how to contribute.
   
2. **Identify & Report Issues**: Before diving into any coding task, make sure the problem is known. If you identify an issue, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/vin-jex/dent-clack/issues/new/choose) detailing the problem.

3. **Attach Screenshots**: If the issue you're reporting can be visually represented (e.g., UI bugs), include screenshots or screen recordings to better illustrate the problem.

4. **Get Assigned**: **Do NOT start working on an issue unless you've been assigned to it**. Issues without an assignee are open for grabs, but to avoid conflicts, you need to be assigned to the issue. If you submit a pull request without being assigned, it will be **closed without being merged**.

5. **Don‚Äôt Remove Code Unless Necessary**: Be careful not to remove or change other parts of the codebase unless absolutely necessary for fixing the issue at hand. **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid making unrelated changes! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

6. **Issue Acceptance**: Before you create a PR, ensure that the issue you are working on has been reviewed and accepted by the maintainers. 

7. **Small, Focused PRs**: Try to keep your pull requests small and focused on a single issue to make it easier for reviewers to evaluate the code and to minimize merge conflicts.

8. **Work on One Issue at a Time**: Only work on one issue at a time to avoid making large, unmanageable pull requests. This also gives others the opportunity to work on different issues simultaneously.

9. **Reference Issues in PR**: In your PR description, always reference the issue number you're addressing (e.g., `Fixes #123`) so the maintainers can easily track your progress.

10. **Branching Strategy**: Never work directly on the main branch! Always create a separate branch for the feature or bug fix you are working on. Detailed instructions on how to create a new branch are available in the section [Getting Started](https://github.com/vin-jex/dent-clack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started).

11. **Fill Out Templates**: Follow the issue and pull request templates when submitting. Properly fill out all the required fields. If you're unsure how, check out existing issues or pull requests, or feel free to ask for help.

12. **Quality Code**: Please ensure that your code does not break the existing codebase. All tests should pass, and the code should be well-structured, commented, and maintainable.

13. **Happy Coding**: Enjoy the contribution process and feel free to ask for help or guidance from the maintainers and the community!
