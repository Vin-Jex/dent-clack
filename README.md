## Branching Strategy

We follow a structured branching strategy to ensure smooth integration and collaboration:

- **Main Branch**: Protected branch. Only the release manager can merge changes into this branch.
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch where feature branches are merged after passing all tests.
- **Feature Branches**: For new features, branch off from `develop` with a naming convention like `feature/feature-name`.
- **Hotfix Branches**: For critical fixes that need to go directly into `main`. Branch off from `main` and use a naming convention like `hotfix/hotfix-name`.
